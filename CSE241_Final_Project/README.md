# Database Systems Final Project
This is my final project for my database class. In this project I designed a database for a car rental company that consists of two views: Employee and Customer.

### Employee:
In the employee view, a company employee or manager can view all existing reservations in the system as well as add new vehicles to the fleet.

### Customer:
In the customer view, visitors can make a reservation for a specific vehicle at a specific location, or return a vehicle that is reserved.


### Errors:
When inputting a car model with more than 20 characters, an exception is thrown.
